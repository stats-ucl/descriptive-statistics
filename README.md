# Docker container for the Foundation Fortnight Descriptive Statistics session

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/stats-ucl/descriptive-statistics/main?urlpath=rstudio)

This repository contains the set up to create a Rstudio environment with all the relevant packages and programmes installed.

This is useful to work on the practical by running the [script](descriptives.R) that has been provided to you. You may want to also install the full configuration on your local machine, but this is useful if you have troubles with some aspects of the installation (eg you didn't have permission to install some packages...).

To run the docker container simply click on the button above (labelled as "launch binder"). This will take you to another URL. The first time you run the container, it may be a bit slow (because it will be compiling the virtual machine), but soon enough you will see Rstudio appearing. You can then work as if you were on your local machine!
